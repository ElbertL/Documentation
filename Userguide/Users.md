## Users

The open smart grid platform allows a to use an username and application name in a request to the open smart grid platform.
Usernames in requests are only used for logging and auditing. The username (and application name) in the SOAP request can me anything.
An username is not mandatory to consume the platform services.

It recommended to use meaningful and correct usernames and application names if want logging and auditing.
