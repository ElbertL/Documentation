## 4.3 Governance

With OSGP we intend to have the right balance between a benevolent Dictator and a Formal Meritocracy to prevent unwanted dictators and everlasting discussions. The basic idea is to make decisions based on consensus. If this takes too long, the community council can be asked to make a decision.

### Community council
This council can make decisions on all community related subject. The community council can be elected by the community members (when the need is there). The community council consists of 5 people. 1 is seat is taken by the OSGP Foundation (once started) for alignment between the foundation and the online community.

The community council is responsible for:

General governance
- Make sure that people can contribute
- How people can contribute
- Infrastructure choices
- Community wide principles
- Procedures
- Governance itself

Direction governance
- Decisions about goals and ambitions
- address concerns

When the community grows, community council members can be elected. If more counsils are needed, the community counsil can decide to start more (sub) councils. If you like to join the community council, contact us!

The community council consist of the following members:
* [Kevin Smeets](https://github.com/kevinsmeets)    Maintainer
* [Bart van der Zwet](https://github.com/bvdzwet)   Maintainer
* [Sander Jansen](https://github.com/Sander3003)    Open source consultant
* Thorben Meijer                                    Marketing expert

The (online) community council meetings will happen once a month.
